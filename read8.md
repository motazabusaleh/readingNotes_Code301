# What Is SQL?
* SQL can be used to share and manage data, particularly data that is found in relational database management systems, which include data organized into tables. Multiple files, each containing tables of data, also may be related together by a common field. Using SQL, you can query, update, and reorganize data, as well as create and modify the schema (structure) of a database system and control access to its data.

# How Learning SQL Works
* Structured Query Language is more straightforward than other more complex programming languages. It is typically easier for beginners to learn SQL than it is for them to pick up languages such as Java, C++, PHP, or C#.

* Several online resources, including free tutorials and paid distance learning courses, are available for those who have little programming experience but want to learn SQL. Formal university or community college courses also will provide a deeper understanding of the language.
