EventName | what do they do?
------------ | -------------
DOMContentLoaded | event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. ... If loaded as usual, stylesheets slow down DOM parsing as they're loaded in parallel, "stealing" traffic from the main HTML document.
hashchange|Events that occur when the anchor part of the URL changes, belongs to the HashChangeEvent Object.
beforeunload|event is fired when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded. The document is still visible and the event is still cancelable at this point. This event enables a web page to trigger a confirmation dialog asking the user if they really want to leave the page
