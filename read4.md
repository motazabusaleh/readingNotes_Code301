# how to use css grid 

* To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid , set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows , and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row . Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter.
