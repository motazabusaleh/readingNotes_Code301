# Templating with Mustache

* Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object. It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops.


# Flexbox


* The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic " flex ".
